      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>Linek Plumbing Company, Inc. has a rich history of providing quality plumbing installations in the St. Louis metropolitan area. The company is supported by an experienced management team and features a veteran staff of licensed, union plumbers from Plumbers’ and Pipefitters’ Local #562.</p>
      <p>In 1916, Linek Brothers Plumbing Company was founded by Frank and Henry Linek specializing in performing repair service and remodeling. After World War I, Frank took over the business as sole proprietor and operated out of his home on California Street in the City of St. Louis. The business operated there until 1970 when it moved to its current location at 24 Kirkham Industrial Drive in Webster Groves.</p>
      <p>Frank and his wife, Anna, had two ambitious sons, Joe and Bill, that followed their father into the plumbing profession. Joe and Bill Linek expanded the company’s scope of work in the 1960s to include larger commercial jobs and continued to maintain and improve residential service and remodeling.</p>
      <p>Bill’s two older sons, Bill, Jr. and Jim entered the business right out of high school and Joe’s son, John joined the company in 1978. All three boys worked in the field to fully understand the business.</p>
      <p>In 1987, Joe retired and Bill, Jr. assumed estimating and office responsibilities. John took over the management of larger commercial jobs and a few years later, Jim gave up field work to run the residential service and remodeling side of the company.</p>
      <p>In 1992, Bill, Sr. retired and Bill, Jr. and Jim took over the day to day operations of the business. Bill, Jr. and Jim have expanded Linek Plumbing Company into a thriving plumbing company specializing in residential service, repair and remodeling and commercial work.</p>
